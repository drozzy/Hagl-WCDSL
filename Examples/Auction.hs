{-

An implementation of the Dollar Auction:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction

Example experiments from GHCi:
> execGame Auction [p1, p2, p3, dim] (once >> printTranscript)
> execGame Auction [p1, p2, p3, dim] (times 100 >> printScore)

(The included strategies are not necessarily good ones and are
merely included as examples...)
